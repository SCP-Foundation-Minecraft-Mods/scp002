# SCP-Foundation-Minecraft-Mods

## Welcome to the SCP-Foundation-Minecraft-Mods GitHub Organization!

This organization is dedicated to the development and distribution of fan-made Minecraft mods inspired by the rich and expansive universe of the **SCP Foundation**. We are a community of passionate developers and fans bringing the anomalous to your Minecraft world.

### About the SCP Foundation

The SCP Foundation is a collaborative creative writing project documenting a fictional secret organization dedicated to containing anomalous entities, locations, and phenomena that threaten the normalcy of the world. The vast majority of the SCP Foundation's content is housed on the official SCP Wiki.

### Our Mission

Our goal is to create high-quality, immersive Minecraft modifications that accurately and respectfully represent the SCP Foundation lore, allowing players to explore, interact with, and contain the anomalous within the game.
